## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays?
*Answer*
  - I have a basic Understanding. Arrays are essentially list declared through bracket notation. I'm trying to be technical in my wording but as we get introduced to more complex concepts the jargon becomes intertwined and confusing. But an array is generally a variable that got named which holds multiple values as elements that are all contained in []*s*

## is there additional learning you need or want to do before the next lesson?
  - How many methods are we supposed to learn and are we expected to memorize methods. Also noted, all but one of the methods introduced today changed the original arr. Some took (push)(situations/arguments) others simply made a copy like (slice). Seems like this can leave room more mass amounts of possibilities is there a trick to know when to apply a certain method or is that just exposure overtime?  

## What questions do you have about Arrays?
 - This question adds on to the prior. In what situations are arrys best practice and how does one know which method to choose for a desired outcome?
